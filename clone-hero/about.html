            I started playing this when I was like 8 or something and i loved it. We got an entire set, 2 guitars at first for guitar hero III then later we got a drumset, a microphone and a World Tour Guitar. All of This on the Wii.
            
        I was pretty proficient and I learned quickly, I started playing on easy than I leanred that and went on to the next difficulty. It didn't take long till I could pass  songs on Expert.

            And at some point I just stopped playing. Maybe because my skills weren't improving as much as before or because of the input lag of the Wii and the TV i was plaing on.

            3 years ago i discoverd <strong>Clone Hero</strong> and it was a blessing. Nostalgia took over and I started to play on my keyboard like a guitar because I didn't know how to use my old guitar without the <a href="https://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/wusbmote_1player_adapter_v3/index.php">Raphnet Adapter</a>.
        
       
            Later I discoverd you could use 
         an old Wii-mote and some software to use a guitar. It was cumbersome and annoying to use but it worked. I played casually for a bit to try to and reignite my skills. I bit the bullet and bought the Adapter and it worked flawlessly. It was quite expensive but worth it. All of the annoying latency was gone and I was playing on 144hz monitor.

        <P>
        And now I'm here, I can get 96% - 99% on most expert songs. My songs library has grown to over 2500.
